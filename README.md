# Irrigation System

The source code is located inside the **ProjectFiles** folder.

This repository contains the prototype code for my academic thesis, which has been published and can be accessed [here](https://repositorio.utfpr.edu.br/jspui/handle/1/28027).

### Project Overview

This code was developed for a Tiva microcontroller with ARM architecture. Due to the severe limitations in compiled code size using a free version of Keil uVision 5, some functionality had to be reduced from the intended design.

### Thesis Abstract

In this work, a microcontroller-based system was developed to monitor soil humidity levels and automate irrigation for indoor plants. A micro water pump is activated by the system when the humidity sensor, placed in the soil, detects that moisture levels fall below a certain threshold. Additionally, the system monitors ambient temperature and notifies the user accordingly. A growth LED can be activated by the system in low-light conditions or according to a user-defined schedule.

The system is designed to assist indoor plant growers who may lack time or experience in plant care. All code was developed in C programming language using Keil uVision 5. Testing was conducted on two plants with different maintenance requirements: one high-maintenance and one low-maintenance. The prototype successfully managed both plants, demonstrating the system's versatility. However, for broader market adoption, cost reductions are necessary.
